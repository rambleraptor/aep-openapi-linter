## Building and Testing

To build and test the project locally, clone the repo and issue the following
commands

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## Adding new rules to the Spectral ruleset

When you add a new rule there are a number of places you should consider
including:

- `spectral.yaml` should define the new rule, possibly pointing to a new
  function used by the rule.
- `functions` directory to hold any new function for the rule.
- `test\<rulename>.test.js` should test at least the error and no-error cases
  of the rule.

## Coding conventions

Please adhere to the following conventions for code submitted to this project:

- Rules in the `spectral.yaml` ruleset file should start with "aep-" and be in
  alphabetical order.
- Functions and tests should follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide].
- When a rule is a custom function, the function name should be the rule name
  minus the "aep-" prefix.
- Rule severity:
  - A rule for a **MUST** guideline in the AEPs or the OpenAPI specification
    should be `severity: error`
  - A rule for a **SHOULD** guideline in the AEPs or the OpenAPI specification
    should be `severity: warn`
  - Other rules may be either `severity: warn` or `severity: info`
  - Do not use `severity: hint` as it is not supported in the VSCode extension
